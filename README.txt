Bank Management software created from an online project idea given to me to help accelerate my knowledge of C.

Program takes a password: pythonftw

Program will take the user into the banking management software where customer information can be manipulated in any manner.
There are minor input validation checks. I did not add a lot as that was not the focus of this learning experience.
I really wanted to get used to file handling without having to do any memory allocation (which will be done in a smaller future project).

Expected project time to complete based of general pseudo code: 10 hours
Actual: 19.6 hours
